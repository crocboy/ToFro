ToFro
=====

A file syncing GUI application written in C#.

ToFro (to and fro) allows you to specify two directories.  It then performs a two-way sync between the two root directories.  For example, any files that are in "A" but not in "B" will be copied to "B", and vice-versa.  I primarily developed this application to keep the music between my computer and my phone in sync.  All songs that I put on my computer but not on my phone will be copied and both my computer and my phone will have the same root directory structure.

Forking and pull requests welcome!
